<h2>About</h2>
<p>I'm a first year spanish linguistics master's student at UIUC. I have a linguistics & psychology degree from UCLA and a linguistics master's degree from CSUF. My main interests are in psycholinguistics, bilingualism, heritage languages and morphosyntax. My first programming experience was using HTML and CSS to design my myspace layout as a tween. My first programming language course was learning C++, which I took as a requirement for my cognitive science minor at UCLA. Since then, I've also learned python to make research data organization easier to manage. Before CTD, I also dabbled in Ruby and JavaScript because I really wanted to build Tumblr and Discord bots. I am also currently learning R. With my coding experience, I hope to explore the ways in which technology can aid in linguistic research analysis. </p>
